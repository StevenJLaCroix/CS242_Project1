### Project Description
The goal of this project was to take extremely raw data (in the form of a text file containing a book) and do some data analysis to discover the most important words in the book relative to the other chapters. The main deliverable to accomplish this was TF-IDF scores for all unique words in the document. Skills used were text parsing, regular expressions, and TF-IDF. One of the major requirements was that we weren't allowed to use any additional packages to assist in finding these scores. Just basic packages such as NumPy and Pandas.
